                                    streams.

                                    502, 503 or 504.

                                    connecting to backend services, for example due to connection timeouts.
                                    - retriable-4xx: Loadbalancer will retry for retriable 4xx response codes.
                                    Currently the only retriable error supported is 409.

                                    REFUSED_STREAM error code. This reset type indicates that it is safe to retry.

                                A list of weighted backend services to send traffic to when a route match
                                occurs. The weights determine the fraction of traffic that flows to their
                                corresponding backend service. If all traffic needs to go to a single backend
                                service, there must be one  weightedBackendService with weight set to a non 0
                                number. Once a backendService is identified and before forwarding the request to
                                the backend service, advanced routing actions like Url rewrites and header

                            in order of priority, from the lowest to highest number. The priority of
                            a rule decreases as its number increases (1, 2, 3, N+1). The first rule
                            that matches the request is applied.

                            You cannot configure two or more routeRules with the same priority.
                            Priority for each rule must be set to a number between 0 and

                                      any 5xx response code, or if the backend service does not respond at all,

                                      connecting to backend services, for example due to connection timeouts.
                                    - retriable-4xx: Loadbalancer will retry for retriable 4xx response codes.
                                      Currently the only retriable error supported is 409.
                                    - refused-stream: Loadbalancer will retry if the backend service resets the stream with a
                                      REFUSED_STREAM error code. This reset type indicates that it is safe to retry.
