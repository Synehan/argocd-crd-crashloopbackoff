                This field is used along with the target field for TargetHttpProxy,
                TargetHttpsProxy, TargetSslProxy, TargetTcpProxy, TargetVpnGateway,
                TargetPool, TargetInstance.

                Applicable only when IPProtocol is TCP, UDP, or SCTP, only packets
                addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded to target.
                Forwarding rules with the same [IPAddress, IPProtocol] pair must have
                disjoint port ranges.

                Some types of forwarding target have constraints on the acceptable
                ports:

                * TargetHttpProxy: 80, 8080
                * TargetHttpsProxy: 443
                * TargetTcpProxy: 25, 43, 110, 143, 195, 443, 465, 587, 700, 993, 995,
                                  1883, 5222
                * TargetSslProxy: 25, 43, 110, 143, 195, 443, 465, 587, 700, 993, 995,
                                  1883, 5222

                This field is used along with the backend_service field for internal
                load balancing.

                When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, a single port or a comma
                separated list of ports can be configured. Only packets addressed to
                these ports will be forwarded to the backends configured with this
                forwarding rule.

                You may specify a maximum of up to 5 ports.

                An optional prefix to the service name for this Forwarding Rule.
                If specified, will be the first label of the fully qualified service
                name.

                The label must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
                Specifically, the label must be 1-63 characters long and match the
                regular expression '[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?' which means the first
                character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters
                must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
                character, which cannot be a dash.

                This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.
